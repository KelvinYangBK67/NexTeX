[繁體中文版本](./CHANGELOG-zh.md)

All notable released changes to IMPE LaTeX System are documented in this file.

For unreleased development notes, see [CHANGELOG.unreleased.md](./CHANGELOG.unreleased.md).

## [0.1.3] - 2026-08-29

### Added

* Added Unicode-range global font routing and reusable range profiles for script-specific font ownership, including range-limited routes for complex and multilingual text.
* Added the `headers` feature with running-head support and `\HeaderTitle{...}` for an explicit short header title.
* Added Tibetan inline/global break behavior that permits breaks after tsheg separators before Tibetan letters or signs while avoiding breaks before Tibetan punctuation.
* Added explicit math font selection with `\UseMathFont{...}` and added `mlmodern` as a registry-backed legacy font route.
* Added hyperlink improvements for repeated heading numbers, reverse heading-to-TOC navigation, and bidirectional footnote-marker links.

### Changed

* Consolidated WenJin Mincho into the `wenjin` family and `\WJ{...}` local command, with Plane 0 / 2 / 3 handled through the CJK fallback chain.
* Refined CJK routing so shared Han ideographs remain on the document's Chinese/CJK font when Japanese, Korean, or Vietnamese Han-Nom families are loaded; language-specific Han forms remain available through `\JP`, `\KR`, and `\HN`.
* Refined CJK and Unicode-range fallback behavior, including Japanese global CJK routing and improved fallback handling for extended Han coverage.
* Updated the Libertinus catalog route to use TeX Live OTF family names and include mono; text-family loading now uses fontspec's `no-math`, preserving Computer Modern math unless Libertinus Math is explicitly selected with `\UseMathFont{libertinus}`.
* Refined paper-layout defaults, two-sided page handling, Chinese UI section numbering, table-of-contents spacing, caption labels, and starred-heading TOC behavior.
* Made numbered paper-layout TOC entries, including chapters and nested sections, expand their number boxes to the natural label width while preserving a stable gap.
* Made index sort keys and descriptions optional, localized the default parentheses, and changed the default index title to the localized standard `\indexname`.
* Refined citation formatting so author lists use `&` as the final-name delimiter, and improved table environment handling and landscape-table support.
* Relaxed TeX badness defaults to reduce noisy overfull/underfull diagnostics and refined quote spacing in the English document layout.

### Fixed

* Fixed range transitions so adjacent Unicode blocks owned by the same font family no longer split a shaping run, preserving Old Hangul clusters across Hangul Jamo and Jamo Extended blocks.
* Fixed WenJin fallback behavior so it follows the active Shanggu/CJK main-font route correctly.

## [0.1.2] - 2026-04-28

### Added
- Registered WenJin Mincho Plane 0 / 2 / 3 as local commands `\WJA`, `\WJB`, and `\WJC`.
- Generated `IMPE-LaTeX-System-v0.1.2-full.zip` and `IMPE-LaTeX-System-v0.1.2-core.zip`.

### Fixed
- Preserved explicit user `\date{...}` values in Chinese UI wrappers instead of overwriting them with the default localized date.

## [0.1.1] - 2026-03-20

### Added
- Added `CHANGELOG.md` to track project release history.
- Added auxiliary cleanup scripts:
  - `scripts/clean_aux.ps1`
  - `scripts/clean_aux.bat`
- Added new registered font families and related catalog/debug coverage updates, including `gentium`, `charis`, and `nabataean`.

### Changed
- Switched installation from full-directory replacement to differential update.
- Updated Arabic font mapping so `arabic` uses Ruqaa for italic channels, while Nastaliq remains dedicated to `urdu`.
- Improved repo-local path resolution for font and system loading.
- Unified feature catalog loading into a single source.
- Expanded font documentation to include registered family listings and mapping notes.

### Fixed
- Fixed installed-mode Chinese wrapper and internal UI loading.
- Fixed local font style propagation so outer italic styling is preserved in commands such as `\textit{\AR{...}}`.
- Fixed multi-paragraph RTL local command handling.
- Fixed Korean local spacing preservation for families marked with `preservespaces = true`.
- Fixed several installed/repo-local path issues exposed by debug examples and external documents.

## [0.1.0] - 2026-03-19

### Added
